# Providers

Aigentic provides a consistent interface for working with different Large Language Model (LLM) providers. This allows you to easily switch between models or use multiple models in your application.

## Model Interface

All model implementations in Aigentic implement the `Model` interface, which defines the contract for interacting with LLM providers:

```kotlin
interface Model {
    val authentication: Authentication
    val modelIdentifier: ModelIdentifier
    val generationSettings: GenerationSettings

    suspend fun sendRequest(
        messages: List<Message>,
        tools: List<ToolDescription>,
    ): ModelResponse
}
```

## Supported Models

Aigentic supports several LLM providers out of the box:

### OpenAI

```kotlin
val openAIModel = OpenAIModel(
    apiKey = "your-api-key",
    model = "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    generationSettings = GenerationSettings(
        temperature = 0.7f,
        topK = 40,
        topP = 0.95f
    )
)
```

### Gemini

```kotlin
val geminiModel = GeminiModel(
    apiKey = "your-api-key",
    model = "gemini-pro",
    generationSettings = GenerationSettings(
        temperature = 0.2f,
        topK = 40,
        topP = 0.8f
    )
)
```

### Ollama

```kotlin
val ollamaModel = OllamaModel(
    baseUrl = "http://localhost:11434",
    model = "llama2",
    generationSettings = GenerationSettings.DEFAULT
)
```
