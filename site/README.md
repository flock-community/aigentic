# Project Name

This is the documentation source of Aigentic, on [aigentic.io](https://aigentic.io)

The website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Maintaining / updating the documentation

As the `site` are part of the Aigentic monorepo, they will automatically be build when building the whole project ([see root readme](../README.md)).

To run docusaurus locally:

1. Navigate to the docs folder

   ```bash
   cd site
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run docusaurus
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
