# Aigentic

Aigentic envisions a future where AI agent development is streamlined through a design-first approach, fostering clarity and efficiency in AI-powered applications. Agent designs, defined in an intuitive and expressive Kotlin DSL, serve as the single source of truth, independent of any specific LLM provider. This design-centric methodology empowers cross-functional teams to collaborate effectively, ensuring alignment between product owners, designers, and developers from the outset. Aigentic embraces the agent-as-a-product mentality, prioritizing user experience and enabling more deliberate and considered AI interactions.

Central to the Aigentic vision is the seamless integration of AI agents into applications. With a powerful Kotlin Multiplatform library, developers can create, deploy, and manage LLM agents with minimal effort, regardless of the underlying model provider. This eliminates repetitive tasks, reduces development time, and ensures consistency across different platforms and environments. The library seamlessly integrates with various LLM providers including OpenAI, Gemini, and Ollama, facilitating flexible deployment options while maintaining a consistent agent behavior, thereby enhancing reliability and minimizing costly revisions in later development stages.

Furthermore, Aigentic's agent designs are invaluable for validating and testing the implementation against the agreed-upon behavior. The design acts as a blueprint, allowing for automated testing to ensure that the agent adheres to the defined capabilities and interactions. Test cases can be created directly from the design, verifying that the agent responses match the expected behavior across different scenarios. This rigorous testing approach, driven by the design, helps identify discrepancies early, guaranteeing reliable and effective AI agents in production environments.
